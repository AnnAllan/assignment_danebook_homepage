# Prototyping the Danebook Homepage

This project kicks off Week 1 of the [Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com).

## Project Requirements

The project is created using an Agile Development approach and managed with [a Pivotal Tracker project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/1149208).  To get started:

1. [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to make a copy and then work locally with a clone of your fork.
2. Check out the [Pivotal Tracker Project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/1149208) to see the stories for this project.  The Acceptance Criteria for each story is listed in the Tasks field.  The mockup is included as a comment on the Epic called "Homepage" (you might need to click the "Epics" tab to display the Epic).
2. Once you've finished each story in the Pivotal Tracker (you don't need to manually check off the Acceptance Criteria / Tasks for this project), push your local copy back up to your fork.
4. Submit your forked repository as a pull request to [this one](https://github.com/vikingeducation/danebook_homepage).  Each of your teammates will do the same with their own projects.
3. Perform a code review on your assigned pair for the week by identifying that person's pull request on the Pull Requests tab and reviewing the files it contains.  
    ![Github Pull Requests Tab](http://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/web_app_eng/github_pull_request_button.png) 
4. Submit your review as [comments to the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#pull-request-discussion).

## To Get Help

Ask your fellow teammates or the instructors for help if you need it.  Though this is intended as an individual project, you are more than welcome to collaborate as you see fit.
