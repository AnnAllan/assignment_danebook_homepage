# Prototyping the Danebook Homepage

This project kicks off Week 1 of the [Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com).

## Link to Your Project "Live":

To render a file like `index.html` on github (instead of just reading its text contents), append the full link (with `http://`) to the file to the string `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?`.  Link to yours here once you've completed it:

## Project Requirements

The project is created using an Agile Development approach and managed with [a Pivotal Tracker project]().  To get started:

1. [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to make a copy and then work locally with a clone of your fork.
2. Check out the [Pivotal Tracker Project]() to see a list of requirements and to view the mockup for this project.  The mockup will be attached to the Epic as a comment.
2. Once you've completed your work, push your local copy back up to your fork.
3. Add the link to display your project to this README file in the section above.  That makes it much easier for your code review pair to see your final product.
4. Submit your forked repository as a pull request to [this one](https://github.com/vikingeducation/danebook_homepage).  Each of your teammates will do the same with their own projects.
3. Perform a code review on your assigned pair for the week by identifying that person's pull request on the Pull Requests tab and reviewing the files it contains.  
    4. ![Github Pull Requests Tab](http://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/web_app_eng/github_pull_request_button.png) 
4. Submit your review as [comments to the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#pull-request-discussion).

## To Get Help

Ask your fellow teammates or the instructors for help if you need it.  Though this is intended as an individual project, you are more than welcome to collaborate as you see fit.
